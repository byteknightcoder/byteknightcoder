üëã About Me
I‚Äôm Timothy Pena, a Senior Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience designing, developing, and delivering robust software solutions across enterprise, fintech, and e-commerce domains. I specialize in .NET technologies, building scalable backend systems, secure APIs, and efficient database-driven applications.
I‚Äôve contributed to high-impact projects at companies like Dell Technologies, Secure Haven LLC, and Dwareapps, where I‚Äôve led backend development efforts, integrated complex third-party APIs, and optimized large-scale distributed systems in production environments.
My development approach emphasizes clean architecture, modular design, and performance-first engineering. I‚Äôm equally comfortable working in cloud-native environments (AWS, Azure) and hybrid on-prem setups, and I regularly collaborate with cross-functional teams to ship reliable, maintainable code.
This GitHub showcases both my freelance and personal work‚Äîreal-world applications, technical demos, and side projects that reflect my passion for quality engineering and practical software design.
